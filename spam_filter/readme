NB_params stores the parameters obtained after training the Naive Bayes Model on the given training data "emails_new.csv".Prior_spam is the fraction of spam mails in the training dataset,"vectorizer_NB" is the one hot encoding of the mails,"word_ham" is the probability of each word in the vocabulary to be a ham mail."word_spam" is the probability of each word in the vocabulary to be a spam mail. 
SVM_params stores the parameters of SVM algorithm."vectorizer_svm" stores the frequency encoding of mails, "classifier_svm" stores the trained model.
output_nb.txt is file where the prediction made by the Naive Bayes Algorithm on the test mails in "test" folder are stored.
output_svm.txt is file where the prediction made by the SVM Algorithm on the test mails in "test" folder are stored.
spam_filter_n.ipynb is the jupyter notebook associated.
"test" directory contains the test mails that needed to be checked against the naive bayes and svm model.
precision obtained using Naive Bayes on given train data : 0.998
precision obtained using SVM on given train data : 0.962
