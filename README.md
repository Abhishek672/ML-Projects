This notebook is a demonstration of how Linear Regression can be implemented with 3 tehniques:
(i)One step derivation of the optimal parameter using Normal Equations.
(ii)Manual Code to Perform the Batch gradient Descent on the Defined Loss Function.
(iii)Using Sklearn Library with hyperparameter Tuning to find the optimal parameters.
